              holistic
              coaches in America to learn more than what was covered with just a ‘basic’ personal training
              qualification.
              Farah has completed a course at the National Institute for Eating Disorders to help women and young
              girls
              address their relationship with both themselves, others and food.

                  years
                  ago. Janka was intrigued to lean more about calisthenics and what her body could do, how it could
                  be
                  strong and move without the use of equipment.

                  Calisthenics allowed Janka to set some new goals outside of the standard gym styles of training.
                  One
                  of her favourite movements is her handstand.

                  Janka is excited to join the team at Fonseca Fitness as the calisthenics coach and work with women
                  and
