                            Lola has a passion to ensure women have knowledge about their body and the power to
                            have
                            autonomy
                            over their bodies.

                        <p class="card-text">Janka is our Calisthenics coach and personal trainer. You’ll see Janka
                            teaching
                            Calisthenics on a Thursday evening.

                            Janka started her fitness journey about 4 years ago and found her way into calisthenics
                            about 3
                            years
                            ago. Janka was intrigued to lean more about calisthenics and what her body could do, how
                            it
                            could
                            be
                            strong and move without the use of equipment.

                            Calisthenics allowed Janka to set some new goals outside of the standard gym styles of
                            training.
                            One
                            of her favourite movements is her handstand.

                            Janka is excited to join the team at Fonseca Fitness as the calisthenics coach and work
                            with
                            women
                            and
                            show them how you can be strong just using your own bodyweight.

                            evenings.
                            Beth is originally from Cape Town, South Africa, where she studied Hatha Yoga.
                            Beth has been teaching yoga for 14 years, and it is absolutely her best career decision
                            ever
                            made.
                            Regular yoga practice not only improves your physical strength, flexibility and
                            stability,
                            but
                            also
                            helps to calm the mind and emotional state, thereby enabling better decisions and
                            reactions.
                            Beth gets great satisfaction seeing women take their journey into yoga and collecting al
                            the
                            benefits
